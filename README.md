OpenAuto is open source automotive shop management software. 

1. If you are a shop with more than 2 bays.... This software is probably not for you.
2. If you do more than $30,000 a month in sales... This software is probably not for you.
3. The reason I am developing this software is self-serving as I run a small shop and want a shop software that handles
only what I need it to do (Repair Orders, Parts Ordering, Invoicing, Card Processing, Quickbooks Integration etc.)
Most shop software has features that I would never use or even know they exist and have no use for them.
4. This application is aimed to hopefully be useful to small shops and mobile techs.


WHAT IT WILL HAVE

1. OpenAuto will have invoicing, parts ordering, customer and vehicle databases, Quickbooks integration for bookkeeping
   (possibly my own accounting down the road but probably not.)
2. Probably more features I can't think of at the moment.


WHAT IT WILL NOT HAVE

1. OpenAuto will not offer SMS or MMS messaging because it would cost me money to implement and if users wanted it I 
have to charge the end user which negates the purpose of this software in the first place.
2. Unless I can find a way to implement Mitchell, Alldata, Motor ETC.. while keeping this software under the GPL
Service data, labor times and plate to vin decoding will not be implemented. I am not too sure because I have not 
researched these API's.
3. Probably a lot more that you would be used to if you use software such as Tekmetric, Mitchell1, ShopWare etc.
